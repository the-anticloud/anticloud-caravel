> Anticloud-hardened packaging of the upstream project `CARAVEL` in category **SEMICONDUCTOR**. Upstream source is vendored in `UPSTREAM_CLONE/` at the pinned commit below; the 12-improvement overlay lives in `anticloud/`. Every fact in this file traces to a file on disk in this project directory.

**Category:** SEMICONDUCTOR · **Upstream:** https://github.com/efabless/caravel · **Upstream pin:** `f534826abc72af4f9d467446b8b82c9471df68da` · **Vendor:** Anticloud FZ LLE

## Configuration

No configuration section was found in the upstream readme. Configuration-relevant files detected in this project directory:

- `Makefile`

Overlay configuration (Anticloud):

- `anticloud/` - improvement overlay; environment-driven, no cloud dependency
- `LEDGERS/` - aioss tamper-evident chain files (per-project, verified with `aioss verify --live`)
- `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/` - reproducibility record (environment, reproduction steps, result register, evidence)
- `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` - 26 framework assessments for this project

---

## Contributing

Upstream contributions: fork the `CARAVEL` project, create a feature branch, and open a pull request against upstream. Keep `UPSTREAM_CLONE/` untouched in this packaging; put improvements in the `anticloud/` overlay.

Overlay contributions: run the 16-check suite before opening a pull request:

```sh
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

## Benchmarks

Measured by the Anticloud assurance suite. Every value below is read from this
project's `BENCH.json`, produced by a real run — the SHA3-256 of that file is
`902d53de35db89bbc286f2fbd385efa191a89efbda5c2631e943afef5eb05fd7`.

| Framework | Controls | Evidence | Coverage | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications | 10 controls mapped | 10 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| OWASP Top 10 (2021) | 9 controls mapped | 9 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| SOC 2 Type II readiness | 9 controls mapped | 9 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| NIST AI Risk Management Framework | 8 controls mapped | 8 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 | 12 controls mapped | 12 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |

| ML Technology Readiness Level | TRL 8 | 8/8 criteria | | PASS |

**Overall: 16/16 checks passing.**

See `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md` for the 16-check register with pass condition, command and observed value per check.

Framework folders in `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` state the control set and the
evidence source bound to each control. This project does not claim an audit
opinion, a SOC report, a FedRAMP authorisation or a PCI attestation — those are
issued by an independent assessor.
